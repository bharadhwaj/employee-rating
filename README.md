# Kudos App - Coworker Rating App
----

Kudos App is a coworkers rating app. You can give kudos to your coworkers on a weekly basis, but to restrict giving out your unconditional love, we are restricting per week 3 kudos. Endorse them and show your support. 

# Features!
  - Weekly you can give out three kudos to your coworkers.
  - You can optionally add a comment saying why you loved working with them.

You can also:
  - See the kudos you received.
  - Kudos left in your pocket for this week.

### Tech Stack

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - Duh!
* [Redux] - too lazy to handle the app state.
* [Material-UI] - Don't reinvent wheel, when you are trying to make a car.
* [Node.js] - [Javascript everwhere!]
* [MySQL] - Cause persistent data is too mainstream.

### Todos

 - Better UI/UX.
 - Confettis.
 - History of Kudos given.
 - Rewards.
